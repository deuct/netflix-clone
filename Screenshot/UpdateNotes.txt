[Update 16 Mei 2022]
In this update i has added the feature of change language. You can do it language change by clicking 
the language button on the top navbar or on the footer language button. When language change happens
all of the pages language will change following language that you have choosen. 
I also added a little bit styling using jquery to rotate the icon of FAQ section. the icon will be "+"
if you're not open the FAQ. and after you're opening the FAQ the icon will turning into "x".

Thats all. Thank you for your attentions.
